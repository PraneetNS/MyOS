# MyOS — Stage 1

A minimal x86 kernel that boots via GRUB (Multiboot2), enters 32-bit
protected mode, and prints to the screen via a hand-written VGA text-mode
driver. This is the foundation stage of a "build your own OS" project.

## What's here

```
boot/
  boot.s       -- Multiboot2 header + assembly entry point (_start)
  linker.ld    -- linker script: places the kernel at the 1MB mark
  grub.cfg     -- tells GRUB how to boot myos.bin
src/
  kernel.c     -- kernel_main(), called from boot.s
  vga.c/.h     -- VGA text-mode driver (writes to 0xB8000)
Makefile
```

## Build & run (Linux, needs gcc, binutils, grub-pc-bin, xorriso, qemu)

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential grub-pc-bin grub-common xorriso qemu-system-x86

make         # builds boot/boot.o, src/*.o, links kernel, makes myos.iso
make run     # boots it in QEMU
```

`make run` uses `-serial stdio -display none`, so if you want to *see*
the VGA output (not just serial), instead run:

```bash
qemu-system-i386 -cdrom myos.iso
```

## What's actually happening on boot

1. GRUB reads the Multiboot2 header in `boot.s`, loads `myos.bin` at 1MB,
   switches the CPU to 32-bit protected mode, and jumps to `_start`.
2. `_start` sets up a stack (GRUB doesn't give you one) and calls `kernel_main`.
3. `kernel_main` calls into the VGA driver, which pokes text-mode video
   memory directly at physical address `0xB8000`.
4. The kernel halts the CPU in a loop (`hlt`) since there's nothing else
   to do yet — no interrupts are enabled, so it'll sit there forever.

## Stage 2 (done): GDT, IDT, PIC, timer, keyboard

- `src/gdt.c` + `boot/gdt_flush.s` — our own flat GDT (5 entries: null,
  kernel code, kernel data, user code, user data — the last two unused
  until Stage 4's userspace/ring 3 work).
- `src/idt.c` + `boot/isr.s` + `boot/idt_flush.s` — 32 CPU exception
  vectors + 16 remapped hardware IRQ vectors, each with its own stub
  (x86 gives no other way to know which interrupt fired). Unhandled
  exceptions now print a message and halt instead of silently
  triple-faulting.
- `src/timer.c` — programs the 8253/8254 PIT to fire IRQ0 at 100Hz.
  Not doing anything with the ticks yet, but this is the heartbeat
  a future preemptive scheduler will hook into.
- `src/keyboard.c` — IRQ1 handler, PS/2 scancode set 1 → ASCII,
  prints typed characters directly. (Shift/caps-lock handling and a
  proper input buffer are Stage 3 polish, not blockers.)

Verified: boots in QEMU, all four "[ok]" lines print, `sti` doesn't
crash, and typed keys echo to the screen — confirming the full pipeline
(PIC → IDT → ISR stub → C handler → VGA) actually works end to end.

## Stage 3 (done): paging and a kernel heap

- `src/multiboot2.h` — parses the Multiboot2 memory map tag GRUB passes in
  (previously ignored; `mb_info_addr` is now actually used).
- `src/pmm.c` — physical memory manager: a bitmap over every 4KB frame,
  seeded from the real memory map (verified: found ~125MB free on a
  128MB QEMU VM, matching expectations exactly).
- `src/paging.c` + `boot/paging_asm.s` — builds a page directory + 4 page
  tables identity-mapping the first 16MB, loads `CR3`, sets `CR0`'s PG
  bit. Vector 14 (#PF) now has a real handler that reads `CR2` and
  prints the faulting address instead of triple-faulting.
- `src/kheap.c` — a first-fit free-list `kmalloc`/`kfree` over a static
  2MB backing region. Splits blocks on allocation, merges adjacent free
  blocks on free.

Verified: zero triple faults with interrupt logging enabled, pmm found
the correct free frame count from the real memory map, the heap
smoke-test (alloc 3 blocks → free the middle → alloc a 4th → confirm it
reused the freed space) passes, and keyboard input still works
correctly with the paging unit live (rules out a whole class of subtle
"stack page not mapped" bugs).

## Stage 4 (next): user-space processes and a scheduler

1. **Task Switching** — save/restore CPU state per task; extend the GDT's
   already-reserved user code/data segments (0x18, 0x20) into real use.
2. **Ring 3** — jump to user-mode via `iret`, with a proper Task State
   Segment (TSS) so the CPU knows where to find the kernel stack on
   privilege-level switches.
3. **System calls** — an `int 0x80`-style (or `syscall` instruction)
   interface so user-mode code can ask the kernel to do privileged things.
4. **Preemptive scheduling** — hook a round-robin scheduler into the PIT
   timer IRQ that's already ticking at 100Hz.
5. **A real filesystem** comes after this — loading and running actual
   programs needs somewhere to load them *from*.

cover this stage's ordering closely.

## Notes on the toolchain choices made here

- **Multiboot2 + GRUB** instead of a hand-rolled bootloader: lets us skip
  real-mode BIOS calls and disk driver code for now and start directly in
  protected mode. Writing your own bootloader is a great *later* exercise,
  not a prerequisite.
- **32-bit (i386), not 64-bit**: long mode requires setting up paging
  *before* the CPU can even execute long-mode code, which is extra
  complexity to front-load. Getting comfortable in protected mode first,
  then transitioning to long mode once paging is understood, is the more
  common learning path.
