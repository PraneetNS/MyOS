# MyOS — Stage 1

A minimal x86 kernel that boots via GRUB (Multiboot2), enters 32-bit
protected mode, and prints to the screen via a hand-written VGA text-mode
driver. This is the foundation stage of a "build your own OS" project.

## What's here

```
boot/
  boot.s       -- Multiboot2 header + assembly entry point (_start)
  linker.ld    -- linker script: places the kernel at the 1MB mark
  grub.cfg     -- tells GRUB how to boot myos.bin
src/
  kernel.c     -- kernel_main(), called from boot.s
  vga.c/.h     -- VGA text-mode driver (writes to 0xB8000)
Makefile
```

## Build & run (Linux, needs gcc, binutils, grub-pc-bin, xorriso, qemu)

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential grub-pc-bin grub-common xorriso qemu-system-x86

make         # builds boot/boot.o, src/*.o, links kernel, makes myos.iso
make run     # boots it in QEMU
```

`make run` uses `-serial stdio -display none`, so if you want to *see*
the VGA output (not just serial), instead run:

```bash
qemu-system-i386 -cdrom myos.iso
```

## What's actually happening on boot

1. GRUB reads the Multiboot2 header in `boot.s`, loads `myos.bin` at 1MB,
   switches the CPU to 32-bit protected mode, and jumps to `_start`.
2. `_start` sets up a stack (GRUB doesn't give you one) and calls `kernel_main`.
3. `kernel_main` calls into the VGA driver, which pokes text-mode video
   memory directly at physical address `0xB8000`.
4. The kernel halts the CPU in a loop (`hlt`) since there's nothing else
   to do yet — no interrupts are enabled, so it'll sit there forever.

## Stage 2 (next): GDT, IDT, and interrupts

Right now you're relying on GRUB's GDT setup and no interrupts are
enabled at all. The next milestones, in order:

1. **Your own GDT** — even a flat GDT you define yourself, so the kernel
   doesn't depend on whatever GRUB set up.
2. **IDT + exception handlers** — so CPU faults (divide-by-zero, page
   fault, general protection fault) print something instead of
   triple-faulting the machine into a silent reboot.
3. **PIC remapping + IRQs** — the legacy 8259 PIC's default interrupt
   vectors collide with CPU exceptions; remap it before enabling interrupts.
4. **Timer + keyboard drivers** — first real IRQ handlers. Timer interrupt
   is also your first step toward preemptive multitasking later.

Resources for this next stage: the OSDev Wiki pages "GDT", "IDT", and
"Interrupts" cover exactly this in order. Philipp Oppermann's "Writing an
OS in Rust" blog covers the same stages if you ever want to compare the
Rust approach to this C one.

## Notes on the toolchain choices made here

- **Multiboot2 + GRUB** instead of a hand-rolled bootloader: lets us skip
  real-mode BIOS calls and disk driver code for now and start directly in
  protected mode. Writing your own bootloader is a great *later* exercise,
  not a prerequisite.
- **32-bit (i386), not 64-bit**: long mode requires setting up paging
  *before* the CPU can even execute long-mode code, which is extra
  complexity to front-load. Getting comfortable in protected mode first,
  then transitioning to long mode once paging is understood, is the more
  common learning path.
